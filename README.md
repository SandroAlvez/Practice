## My process

Basicaly the process took 2 steps:

First I built the general tags I wanted to use (section, divs and footer) giving their Id's and then I filled them with the content.

Then, I started styling with CSS and reload the browser while comparing it with the model.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

This challenge was useful to reinforce my knowledge on image manipulation.
